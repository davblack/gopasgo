func Get(url string) (resp *Response, err error)
    Get issues a GET to the specified URL. If the response is one of the
    following redirect codes, Get follows the redirect, up to a maximum of 10
    redirects:

        301 (Moved Permanently)
        302 (Found)
        303 (See Other)
        307 (Temporary Redirect)
        308 (Permanent Redirect)

    An error is returned if there were too many redirects or if there was an
    HTTP protocol error. A non-2xx response doesn't cause an error. Any returned
    error will be of type *url.Error. The url.Error value's Timeout method will
    report true if the request timed out.

    When err is nil, resp always contains a non-nil resp.Body. Caller should
    close resp.Body when done reading from it.

    Get is a wrapper around DefaultClient.Get.

    To make a request with custom headers, use NewRequest and DefaultClient.Do.

    To make a request with a specified context.Context, use
    NewRequestWithContext and DefaultClient.Do.
