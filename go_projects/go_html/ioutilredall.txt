package ioutil // import "io/ioutil"

func ReadAll(r io.Reader) ([]byte, error)
    ReadAll reads from r until an error or EOF and returns the data it read. A
    successful call returns err == nil, not err == EOF. Because ReadAll is
    defined to read from src until EOF, it does not treat an EOF from Read as an
    error to be reported.

    As of Go 1.16, this function simply calls io.ReadAll.
